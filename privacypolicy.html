	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Privacy in my iOS Apps</h2>
	<p>All of the apps developed by Janis Hutz follow strict privacy rules. As such, my Apps do not collect any data other than the standard data that is being collected by Apple to give me an idea on how many people use the app. You may opt out of that feature in the system settings. All of the data collected there is anonymised and I therefore cannot see anything other than a higher number on the active user data. Privacy is one of the most important factors in the development of my apps! This may have an impact on the stability of the apps, so please, if you would like, enable "Share with Developers" setting in the Settings app under "Privacy" > "Analytics & Improvements". This allows me to see an anonymised crash report if the app'd crash. 
		I do heavily rely on AppStore Reviews, Ratings and Beta feedback to improve my apps, as this is the least privacy invading option out there. Please also contact me, if you'd like to test this app as a beta!</p>
	<h2>Privacy on janishutz.com</h2>
	<p>This website does not collect any data on your interaction with it as it stands today. This may change in the future, but all data collected will not allow me to uniquely identify you as an individual. You may have a look at the source code of the data-collection module, if I end up adding one on this website, if you wish. The rest of the server backend will remain closed-source due to security concerns.</p>
